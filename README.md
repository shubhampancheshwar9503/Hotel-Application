# Hotel Application

HotelApplication is a simple console-based Java program simulating a menu-driven restaurant ordering system. It allows users to select vegetarian or non-vegetarian dishes from a predefined menu, input the desired quantity, and then calculates and displays the total amount to be paid.

##Features:

#User Input Validation: Basic error handling for invalid menu selections.

#How It Works:

The user is welcomed and presented with a choice between Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian dishes.
Upon selecting a category, the user is shown a list of available dishes with corresponding prices.
The user can then select a dish and enter the desired quantity.
The program calculates and displays the total amount to be paid.

##Getting Started:
#Requirements: Ensure you have Java installed.
#Run the Application: Compile and run the HotelApplication.java file using a Java IDE or the command line.
